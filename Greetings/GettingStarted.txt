Welcome to Java

Firstly to run your Java app we want to create an empty file with the 
file and class name matching.

then with a simple message like we have below with hello world, we will
compile our code with the command 
"javac NameOfFile.Java".

To actually run the application we must use the command 
"java NameOfFile"

EVERY TIME you edit a file, YOU MUST re-compile it!!
