Array Lists

- If you are familiar with javascript and python you are likely already familiar with mutable arrays
and in Java we also have a type of mutable array that we call Array Lists. You are able to add and delete
spaces in the array as needed. you also must make use of the util module with an ArrayList

    lets get started with the following line of code:

import java.util.ArrayList;
ArrayList<Integer> myArray = new ArrayList<Integer>();

the Integer spot is what we call generics
